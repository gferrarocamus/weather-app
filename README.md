# Weather App

This web app allows you to get current weather details for a city of your interest. Simply type in a city name to get started.

It is built with vanilla JavaScript, CSS, and HTML and bundled with Webpack.

## Features

- The data is retrieved live from [OpenWeather](https://openweathermap.org/).
- The default temperature unit is °C with the possibility of toggling it to °F.

## Future Features

- Add typeahead to suggest city name as user types.
- Support search by geolocation.

## Install

To run locally, make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed.

After cloning the repo, install the necessary packages inside the project directory:

```
$ npm install
```

You're ready to start developing. 

Build any changes to the project with `$ npx webpack`, or have all changes built automatically by running `$ npx webpack --watch` in a separate terminal while you develop.
